This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic substitution cipher used in cryptography. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Features
âœ… Encrypts plaintext using a user-defined shift value
âœ… Decrypts ciphertext by reversing the shift
âœ… Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
âœ… Handles non-alphabetic characters without modification

Usage
Provide an input text and a shift value.
The program will return the encrypted (or decrypted) text.
Ideal For
ðŸ”¹ Learning about basic cryptography
ðŸ”¹ Understanding classical encryption techniques
ðŸ”¹ Implementing simple secure text transformations
